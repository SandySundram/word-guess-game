# Hangman Travel - Game Instructions

### Overview

Hangman Travel is based on the classic hangman game and the theme is places around the world. So, lets buckle in and jet, set, go!!!

### Rules of the game

1. The infomation box just under the page header should give you all the infomation you need to play the game. It will tell you how to start the game, how your are doing so far and, will even provide a hint to you if the guess count is running is low.

2. A player gets 10 tries to guess the entire destination/place word.

3. When the game begins, your destination/place to guess will display under the _YOUR DESTINATION_ section and each letter of the word will show as a `_`

4. The letters selected by the user will display under the _Your Guesses so far_ section. If you enter a letter that has already been guessed, it will not be counted as a valid selection - your number of guesses will remain the same.

5. For every incorrect guess (letter guessed is not part of the destination/place word), the _Guesses Left_ counter will decrease by one.

6. When the _Guesses Left_ reaches 3 and you are still not able to guess the word, the game will give you a hint corresponding to the destination/place.

7. If you are unable to guess the destination/place within 10 attemps, your _LOSSES_ counter will increase by one and the game will reset to start a new game.

8. If you are able to successfully guess the destination/place within 10 attempts, your _WINS_ counter will increase by one and the game will reset to start a new game.

**That is all there is to it**

**Have fun playing**
